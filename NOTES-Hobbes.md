### According to Hobbes:

1.  Humans exist in a chaotic metaphorical **state of nature**, individuals out for themselves, power and wealth are spread out without any consolidation.
2. Humans come together to form a confederacy or a state. Giving up their **natural rights** for a promise of a **state** that upholds peace. However, no promise that the state (According to Hobbes, the state is a divine ruler) won't abuse this power.
3. Individuals in the confederacy have no right to revolt. As that would leave back to the **state of nature**.

### State of Nature

aka the **"condition of mere nature"**, characterized by the "war of every man against every man", a constant and violent competition in which each individual has the natural right to everything, regardless of the interests of others.

In the absence of a higher authority to resolve disputes, everyone fears and mistrusts everyone else. And there can be no justice, commerce, industry, arts, letters, account of time, knowledge.

In Hobbes' state of nature, no person is invulnerable nor capable of dominating all others.
Additionally, Hobbes ascribes to each individual the right to self preservation. **"The right of nature"** is the right to do whatever one sincerely judges needful for one's preservation; due to the loose definition of this right virtually anything can be viewed as necessary to ensure self preservation.

Taken together, this *state of nature* is a state of constant of war over limited resources. People will naturally fear that others may invade and attack to take their resources (the right of nature). More than resources, religious or cultural beliefs will also illicit conflict. Resulting in a constant state of war of **"all against all"** 

This **State of Nature** can be interpreted in 2 main ways:
- Individuals in the state of nature **are irrational and shortsighted**. Therefore they indulge their current interests with proper considerations of their long term effects.
- Individuals in the state of nature **are perfectly rational**. However, they are trapped in a situation that would make it individually rational for each individual to act in a way that is sub-optimal for **all**. Similar to the **Prisoner's dilemma**.

### The Social Contract and Establishing Sovereign Authority

When people mutually **covenant** each to the others to obey a common authority, they have established what Hobbes calls **“sovereignty by institution”**.

When, threatened by a conqueror, they covenant for protection by promising obedience, they have established **“sovereignty by acquisition”**.

These are equally legitimate ways of establishing sovereignty, according to Hobbes, and their underlying motivation is the same—**namely fear**—whether of one’s fellows or of a conqueror. The social covenant involves both the renunciation or transfer of right and the authorization of the sovereign power. *Political legitimacy depends not on how a government came to power, but only on whether it can effectively protect those who have consented to obey it; political obligation ends when protection ceases.*

The **condition of mere nature** comes to an end when individuals agree together to relinquish their natural rights to everything and transfer their self-sovereignty to a higher civil authority, **the Leviathan**.

#### The Absolute Authority

According to Hobbes, Effective government can only come in the form of an **Absolute Monarchy** with **Absolute Authority**. 

Only a government that posses all the **"essential rights of sovereignty"** can be reliably effective. Dividing the powers of legislation, adjudication, enforcement, taxation, and war-making ..., can result in several **conflicting interpretations** that disagree in their judgement, resulting in a **paralysis of effective government**, or degeneration into a **civil war** (a form of state of nature).

Similarly, to impose limitation on the authority of the government is to invite irresoluble disputes over whether it has overstepped those limits. If each person is to decide for herself whether the government should be obeyed, factional disagreement—and war to settle the issue, or at least paralysis of effective government—are quite possible.

### Criticisms

**Of the state of nature:**

1. A purely individualistic state of nature never existed (family bonds, bonds of affection).
2. A purely individualistic state of nature never existed. However, something close and resembling it remains a perpetual possibility.
3. Hobbes attempts to prove the existence of the state of nature by pointing to Native Americans or Africans as contrast to the civilized Europeans. Eurocentric and stupid
